copy_file:copy_file: Duplicates a file to a specified location. Parameters: source_path (required): Path of the file to copy. destination_path (required): Path for the copied file, must be compatible with the source's format. Invoke multiple times to verify filesystem state.
file_delete:file_delete: Deletes a specified file. Parameters: file_path (required): Absolute or relative path from the root directory. Ensure the path is accurate and the file exists. Invoke the tool multiple times to confirm file system state. Avoid non-standard paths or unsupported commands.
file_search:file_search: Use to recursively find files in a specified subdirectory. Parameters: 'dir_path' for the subdirectory path, and 'pattern' for Unix shell glob patterns (e.g., '*.ext' for extensions). Avoid regex syntax. Tool can be invoked multiple times for accurate validation.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with precise paths. Ensure both source and destination paths include file names and directories exist. Validate paths before execution. Use separate invocations for complex operations. Example: To move and rename, specify 'source_path:/old/path/file.txt' and 'destination_path:/new/path/new_name.txt'.
read_file:read_file: Retrieve a file from disk using a precise file path. Parameter 'file_path' must be a complete path to an existing file, not a directory. Verify the file exists and is accessible. Example: {'file_path':'/project/code/main.py'}. Invoke the tool multiple times if needed to confirm file system changes.
write_file:write_file: Write to a file with these parameters: file_path (string, required) - target file path; text (string, required) - content to write; append (boolean, required) - true to append, false to overwrite. Ensure distinct file_path and text inputs. Example: {'file_path':'path/to/file.txt','text':'Hello, World!','append':true}. Invoke multiple times for state validation.
list_directory:list_directory: List files and directories in a specified folder. Use absolute paths without spaces or special characters. Validate paths to avoid errors. Example: list_directory(dir_path='01_Projects/01_ProjectA/01_Code'). The tool can be invoked multiple times to ensure accurate file system state.
