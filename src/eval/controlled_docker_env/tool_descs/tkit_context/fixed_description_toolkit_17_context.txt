copy_file:copy_file: Duplicate a file to a specified location. Parameters: source_path (absolute path of the file to copy), destination_path (absolute path to save the copy). Ensure paths are valid files. This tool only supports copying files, not folders or moving/renaming files. Invoke multiple times for path validation. Example: Copy '/path/to/source.txt' to '/path/to/destination.txt'.
file_delete:file_delete: Remove a file by specifying a valid file path as 'file_path'. Ensure paths are correct and free of special characters or spaces. Validate paths with a file system tool before use. The tool can be invoked multiple times for better validation.
file_search:file_search: Recursively search files in a directory matching a Unix shell regex pattern ('*' for any char sequence). Parameters: dir_path (exact subdirectory path), pattern (e.g., '*.csv'). Verify paths and patterns. Invoke multiple times for validation. Examples: {'dir_path': 'subdir', 'pattern': '*.docx'}.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with specified paths. Ensure distinct source and destination. Verify file existence before operation. Example: Move 'file.txt' from '/start' to '/end/file.txt'. Use absolute paths for accuracy. Invoke multiple times for validation.
read_file:read_file: Retrieve a file using its full path from the root directory, ensuring directory names and file extensions are correct, e.g., 'Projects/Code/main.py'. Validate paths to confirm file existence. Invoke multiple times to check file system changes.
write_file:Use 'write_file' to write or append text to a file. Parameters: 'file_path' (required, valid path of the file), 'text' (required, content to write), 'append' (optional, true to append). Ensure file format supports text operations. Validate paths and file existence. Confirm content is distinct from paths. Invoke tool multiple times for validation.
list_directory:list_directory: List files and directories in a specified folder. Parameters: dir_path - a valid directory path. Ensure the path is correct and points to a directory. Avoid specifying files or using incorrect path formats. Invoke multiple times for continuous validation.
