copy_file:copy_file: Duplicate a specific file to a designated location. Ensure both 'source_path' and 'destination_path' are complete, with extensions. Only files, not directories, should be specified. Validate paths for existence and correctness. Tool can be invoked multiple times for better accuracy. Example: {'source_path': 'src/file.txt', 'destination_path': 'dst/file_copy.txt'}.
file_delete:file_delete: Deletes a file given its absolute path. Ensure the file path exists and is correctly formatted. Avoid relative paths or vague references. The tool can be invoked multiple times to validate the file system state. Example: {'file_path': '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'}
file_search:file_search: Search files in a subdirectory using Unix shell wildcards. Parameters: dir_path: Full directory path (e.g., 'ProjectA/docs'). pattern: Shell wildcard (e.g., '*.md'). Ensure paths are correct. Use multiple invocations to validate filesystem state.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file by providing full paths, including filenames, for both source and destination. Use when the file needs relocation or renaming. Validate paths and permissions. Invoke multiple times for accurate file system validation. Examples: Move file.txt from A/B to C/D/renamed.txt; Relocate data.csv within project folders.
read_file:read_file: Retrieve file contents with parameters: file_path (required): Provide the exact file path with directories and extension. Ensure the path exists. E.g., 'Projects/Code/main.py'. Use multiple invocations for state validation.
write_file:write_file: Writes text to a specified file path. Parameters: file_path (required, valid path string), text (required, content to write), append (optional, true to append, false to overwrite). Ensure clear distinctions between file paths and content. Invoke multiple times for state validation. Examples: Write 'Hello' to 'hello.txt'; append 'World' to 'hello.txt'.
list_directory:list_directory: Lists all files and folders in the specified directory. Input must be a valid directory path, not a search query or file type filter. Example: {'dir_path': 'ProjectA/Docs'}. Invoke multiple times for a full filesystem overview.
