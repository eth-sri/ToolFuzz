copy_file:copy_file: Copy a file by providing complete paths with filenames and extensions for both source and destination. Paths must refer to valid files, not directories. Validate paths and filesystem state before and after execution. Examples: {'source_path': 'ProjectA/docs/readme.txt', 'destination_path': 'Research/Papers/readme.txt'}.
file_delete:file_delete: Delete a file using 'file_path', which must be a valid, absolute or relative path. Ensure the file exists and is accessible. The tool can be invoked multiple times to confirm file system state. Avoid ambiguous paths.
file_search:file_search: Recursively search for files in a subdirectory using Unix shell patterns. Ensure dir_path is formatted without spaces or special characters. Use '*' to match any sequence of characters. Validate usage by testing multiple invocations. Example: {'dir_path': 'ProjectA/input', 'pattern': '*.csv'}.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with these parameters: source_path (required): Current file path. destination_path (required): Target file path, either a new directory or filename. Do not combine moving and renaming in one step. Validate paths before operation. Invoke tool multiple times for sequential operations. Examples: Move 'folder1/file.txt' to 'folder2/file.txt'; Rename 'folder1/file.txt' to 'folder1/newname.txt'.
read_file:read_file: Provide an exact, case-sensitive file path to read a file from disk. Ensure the path exists and matches the file name. Avoid descriptive names. The tool can be invoked multiple times for system validation. Example: 'file_path':'01_Projects/01_ProjectA/03_Data/input/data.txt'.
write_file:write_file: Save text to a specified file path. Parameters: file_path (required, existing path), text (required, content to save), append (optional, true/false). Validate path and permissions. Use absolute paths. Tool can be invoked multiple times for state validation. Examples: 'write_file(file_path='path/to/file.txt', text='Hello', append=false)'
list_directory:list_directory: Lists files and directories in a specified folder. Input 'dir_path' must be an explicit, existing directory path. Ensure paths are formatted correctly. Tool can be used multiple times for validation. Example: {'dir_path':'01_Projects/01_ProjectA/03_Data/input'}.
