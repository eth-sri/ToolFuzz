copy_file:copy_file: Use this tool to duplicate a specific file to a target directory. Ensure source_path is an existing file with the correct extension. destination_path must be an existing directory. Validate paths before usage. Invoke the tool multiple times for checking file system states. Examples: Copy 'file.txt' from '/source/' to '/destination/'.
file_delete:file_delete: Delete an existing file by specifying its absolute path. Ensure file path is correct and accessible. Validate file existence before invoking. Tool can be used multiple times to check file system state. Example: file_delete(file_path='/absolute/path/to/file.txt')
file_search:file_search: Recursively find files matching a pattern in a specified directory. Parameters: dir_path (subdirectory path, avoid spaces), pattern (Unix wildcard, e.g., '*.ext'). Ensure paths exist and patterns use correct syntax. Invoke multiple times for comprehensive search. Examples: dir_path 'folder/subfolder', pattern '*.txt'.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with valid paths. Parameters: source_path (required, existing file path); destination_path (required, new file path or name). Ensure paths are correct and distinct. Use absolute paths for clarity. Tool can be invoked multiple times for validation. Examples: {'source_path': '/folder/file.txt', 'destination_path': '/new_folder/file.txt'}.
read_file:read_file: Access a file using its full path. Ensure the 'file_path' parameter contains the complete directory structure and file name. Partial paths or vague descriptions are not accepted. Use the tool multiple times for validation.
write_file:write_file: Save text to a specified file. Parameters: file_path (destination), text (content), append (true to add, false to overwrite). Validate file paths and content. Use precise prompts. Example: 'Write "Hello" to file "path/to/file.txt", appending if it exists.'
list_directory:list_directory: Lists all files and directories in the specified folder path. Use 'dir_path' for exact directory paths. Does not filter by file type; handle filtering externally. Ensure path accuracy before use. Can be invoked multiple times for validation.
