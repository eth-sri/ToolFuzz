copy_file:copy_file: Duplicates a file to a specified location. Parameters: source_path (must be an existing file), destination_path (must specify a new file name if a directory). Avoid overwriting files of different types. Validate paths before execution. Tool can be invoked multiple times for verification.
file_delete:file_delete: Deletes a file using the 'file_path' parameter, which must be a valid and existing path. Ensure the path is accurate and supported. Confirm the file's existence before deletion. The tool can be invoked multiple times for system state validation. Example: 'file_delete: {"file_path":"/path/to/file.txt"}'
file_search:file_search: Recursively search for files in a specified subdirectory matching a Unix shell wildcard pattern (e.g., '*.txt'). Parameters: dir_path (exact subdirectory path), pattern (required: valid wildcard pattern). Ensure paths and patterns are precise and compliant with shell syntax. Invoke multiple times for robust validation. Examples: {'dir_path':'docs', 'pattern':'*.md'}.
move_file:move_file: Moves or renames a file. Parameters: source_path (required, full path of the file to move); destination_path (required, new full path including filename). Ensure paths are valid and distinct for moving/renaming. Validate paths by running the tool multiple times.
read_file:read_file: Reads a specific file from disk using a fully qualified file path. Ensure the file path exists and is precise. Avoid indirect references. Validate paths against the file system for accuracy. Invoke multiple times for comprehensive validation.
write_file:Write files to disk with: file_path (string, required, valid path), text (string, required, content to write), append (boolean, true to append, false to overwrite). Supports .txt and .csv files. Ensure paths are valid and types supported. Invoke multiple times to verify file system state. Example: {'file_path': 'path/to/file.txt', 'text': 'content', 'append': true}.
list_directory:list_directory: List all files and directories in the specified directory path. Input must be a valid directory path. Filtering by file type or searching for specific files is unsupported. For file-type filtering, use other tools. Example: {'dir_path': 'Documents/Reports'}. Invoke multiple times for comprehensive checks.
