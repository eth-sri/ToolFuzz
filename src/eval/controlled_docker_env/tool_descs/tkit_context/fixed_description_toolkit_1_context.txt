copy_file:copy_file: This tool copies a file from a source to a destination. Ensure the source exists and the destination path includes the filename. This tool does not move files. Verify paths pre-execution. Run multiple times for validation. Example: {'source_path':'folder1/file.txt','destination_path':'folder2/file_copy.txt'}.
file_delete:file_delete: Delete a file with the following parameters: file_path:required:Provide an exact, absolute path to the file you wish to delete. Ensure the file exists before execution. The tool can be invoked multiple times for file system validation. Invalid paths or non-existent files will not be processed.
file_search:file_search: Locate files in a specified subdirectory using Unix shell wildcards. Parameters: dir_path (valid Unix-style path) and pattern (e.g., '*.txt'). Avoid complex regex. Invoke multiple times for comprehensive validation of the file system.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with strict path validation. Parameters: source_path (existing file path), destination_path (new path, including filename in the same directory). Ensure destination directory exists and does not imply creation. Invoke multiple times for complex operations. Examples: Moving 'src/file.txt' to 'src/old/file.txt' or renaming 'src/file.txt' to 'src/file_old.txt'.
read_file:read_file: This tool reads a file's contents from disk using a precise, explicit file path (file_path:required). It doesn't process metadata or indirect queries. Validate paths for accuracy and existence. Invoke multiple times for file system state validation.
write_file:write_file: Save content to disk with these parameters: file_path (required): valid path for file, text (required): content to write, append (optional): true to add to existing content, false to overwrite. Validate file paths and content. Invoke multiple times for file state checks. Examples: 'Write text to path/file.txt' or 'Append data to existing path/file.txt'.
list_directory:list_directory: Lists all files and subdirectories in a specified directory. Parameters: dir_path (required): The exact path to the directory. This tool does not filter by file type or content. For accurate results, ensure the path is correct and use additional methods for filtering. The tool can be invoked multiple times to check the current state of the file system. Example: To list contents of 'ProjectA/Code', use dir_path='ProjectA/Code'.
