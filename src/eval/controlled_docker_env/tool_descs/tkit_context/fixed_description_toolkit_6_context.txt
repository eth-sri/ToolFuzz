copy_file:copy_file: Duplicate a file to a specified location. Use valid paths for source_path and destination_path. Source must exist; destination should include file name if creating a new file. Validate paths beforehand. Can be invoked multiple times for system state checks.
file_delete:file_delete: Correctly delete files by providing full paths (e.g., 'folder/subfolder/file.txt'). Confirm path existence before deletion. Avoid shorthand or ambiguous requests. Invoke the tool multiple times to verify file state. Examples: Delete '01_Projects/01_ProjectA/03_Data/input/data.csv'.
file_search:file_search: Search files in a subdirectory using Unix shell-style patterns. Parameters: dir_path (accurate subdirectory path), pattern (use '*' for wildcards). Avoid regex symbols like '\.'. Validate paths and patterns. Invoke multiple times for current file state.
move_file:move_file: Relocate or rename a file with parameters: source_path: Absolute path of the existing file. destination_path: Absolute path where the file will be moved or renamed. Ensure directories exist. Use separate operations for moving and renaming. Invoke iteratively to validate filesystem state. Example: Move '/path/file.txt' to '/newpath/file.txt'.
read_file:read_file: Access file contents from disk. Parameters: file_path: required; must be a full path including filename and extension. Only reads file content; does not support metadata extraction. Use exact paths. Validate path existence before use. Can be invoked multiple times for comprehensive checks.
write_file:write_file: Save text to a file with parameters: file_path (string, required) - valid path; text (string, required) - content to write; append (boolean) - append content if true. Only text-based files are supported. Validate file paths and content before use. Invoke tool multiple times if needed for file system validation. Examples: 'Write to file_path: 'example.txt' with text: 'Hello World'' or 'Append to file_path: 'example.txt' with text: 'New Content'.'
list_directory:list_directory: Use to list files and directories in a specified folder. Ensure 'dir_path' is a valid, existing directory path, without file names. For comprehensive checks, invoke the tool multiple times.
