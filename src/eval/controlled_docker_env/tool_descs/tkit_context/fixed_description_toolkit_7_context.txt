copy_file:copy_file: Duplicate a file to a specified location. Parameters: source_path:required:Exact file path to copy, destination_path:required:Exact path with the same extension to save the copy. Only files, no directories. Validate paths and extensions before execution. Invoke multiple times for verification.
file_delete:file_delete: Safely delete a file. Parameter: file_path (required): Absolute, valid path to the file to delete. Ensure the file exists before requesting deletion. Avoid ambiguous terms and ensure proper file extension. Invoke the tool multiple times to verify file system state.
file_search:file_search: Recursively find files in a specified subdirectory using Unix shell-style wildcards. Parameters: dir_path: Relative subdirectory path. pattern: required wildcard pattern (e.g., *.ext). Avoid regex syntax. Invoke multiple times for thorough validation. Examples: {'dir_path': 'docs', 'pattern': '*.md'}, {'dir_path': 'output', 'pattern': '*.csv'}.
move_file:move_file: Relocate or rename a file with specified paths. Ensure 'source_path' exists and 'destination_path' is valid. Use clear, absolute, or consistent relative paths. Validate paths pre-execution. Multiple invocations help verify filesystem status. Examples: {'source_path':'/path/to/source.ext', 'destination_path':'/path/to/destination.ext'}.
read_file:read_file: Access specific files on the disk. Usage requires 'file_path' with full directory path and file name, including extensions. Avoid vague names; specify paths exactly as they exist on the system. Validate paths before use. Example: {'file_path':'Projects/Code/main.py'}.
write_file:write_file: Save text to a valid file path (e.g., .txt, .csv). Parameters: file_path (required, must exist), text (required, non-empty), append (true/false). Validate file existence and permissions. Use for updating or creating files. Multiple invocations recommended for validation.
list_directory:list_directory: List all files and subdirectories in a specified directory. Parameters: dir_path - Absolute or relative path to the directory. Only directory paths are accepted. Repeat calls for updated states. Avoid querying specific file types or operations.
