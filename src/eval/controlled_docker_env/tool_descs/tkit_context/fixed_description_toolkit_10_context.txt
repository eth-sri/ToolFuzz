copy_file:copy_file: Duplicate a file to a specified path. Parameters: source_path (required, full path to the file), destination_path (required, full path with file name). Ensure paths point to files, not directories. Extensions must match. Validate paths and file existence. Use multiple invocations for filesystem state checks.
file_delete:file_delete: Delete a file at a specified, valid, and accessible path. Parameters: file_path (required): Full path of the existing file to delete. Ensure the file exists and is accessible. Use the tool to verify the file system state. Examples: 'Delete file at /path/to/file.txt'.
file_search:Use file_search to find files matching a Unix shell regex within a specified subdirectory. Define 'dir_path' precisely as in the file system and 'pattern' using Unix shell syntax (e.g., '*.ext'). Invoke multiple times for validation. Examples: {'dir_path':'sub/dir','pattern':'*.txt'}.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with absolute paths for both source and destination. Ensure paths are valid and files exist. Example: Move '/path/to/source/file.txt' to '/path/to/destination/new_file.txt'. Use multiple invocations to validate file system state.
read_file:read_file: Read a file from disk. Parameters: file_path (required): Full path including file name and extension. Avoid vague names or incomplete paths. Validate paths for existence and correct format. The tool can be invoked multiple times for state checks.
write_file:write_file: Save text to a valid, existing file path with supported formats (.txt, .csv). Parameters: file_path (required, existing path), text (required, string), append (optional, for text files only). Ensure paths are correct. Invoke multiple times to validate file system state.
list_directory:list_directory: List all files and directories in a specified folder. Usage requires 'dir_path', a valid directory path. The tool does not filter by file type or search for specific files. Example: {'dir_path':'/example/directory'}. Invoke multiple times for comprehensive directory checks.
