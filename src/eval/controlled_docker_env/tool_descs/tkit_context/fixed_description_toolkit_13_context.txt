copy_file:copy_file: Copy a file to a new location. Parameters: source_path (required): Valid file path. destination_path (required): Valid destination path with matching file name and extension. Ensure paths are files, not directories. Validate paths before use. Invoke multiple times for thorough validation. Examples: {'source_path': 'dir/file.txt', 'destination_path': 'backup/file.txt'}.
file_delete:file_delete: Delete a specified file. Parameters: file_path (required): Exact path of an existing file. Ensure the path is correct and accessible. Validate file existence and permissions before deletion. The tool can be used multiple times for validation.
file_search:file_search: Search for files in a subdirectory using Unix shell glob patterns like '*.ext'. Parameters: 'dir_path' (valid subdirectory path) and 'pattern' (e.g., '*.docx'). Avoid regex. Verify path and pattern before use. Tool can be invoked multiple times for file system validation. Examples: {'dir_path':'01_Projects/02_ProjectB','pattern':'*.jpg'}.
move_file:move_file: Relocate or rename a file with parameters: source_path (existing file path) and destination_path (target path). Ensure paths are valid and directories exist. Confirm no overwriting without consent. Validate file system state by invoking tool multiple times. Example: move_file(source_path='src/main.py', destination_path='dest/main.py').
read_file:read_file: Access a file using its exact file path. Parameter: file_path (required) - absolute path of file. Avoid descriptive names; use exact directory and file names. Validate paths before use. Tool can be invoked multiple times for state validation. Examples: {'file_path':'/path/to/main.py'}.
write_file:To use 'write_file', specify: 'file_path' (target file path), 'text' (content to write), 'append' (true to append, false to overwrite). Ensure 'text' is not a file path. Validate parameters before execution. Can be invoked multiple times to check file system state.
list_directory:list_directory: List files and directories in a specified folder. Use exact directory paths in 'dir_path' as strings. Ensure paths exist and avoid indirect references. Examples: {'dir_path':'01_Field_Data/02_Weather_Data'}. Invoke multiple times if needed.
