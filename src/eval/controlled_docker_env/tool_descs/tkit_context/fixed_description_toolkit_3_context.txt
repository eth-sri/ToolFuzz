copy_file:copy_file: Duplicates a file to a specified location. Ensure both source and destination paths exist, specify complete paths and filenames, and confirm no naming conflicts. Invoke tool multiple times if needed to validate filesystem state. Avoid overwriting files unless intended. Example: {'source_path':'/path/to/source.txt', 'destination_path':'/path/to/destination.txt'}.
file_delete:file_delete: To delete a file, provide an absolute path of an existing file. Ensure the path is correct and validated. Avoid vague descriptions or relative paths. The tool can be invoked multiple times to check file system state. Examples: {'file_path':'/absolute/path/to/file.txt'}.
file_search:file_search: Search files in a subdirectory using Unix shell patterns (e.g., '*.txt') with parameters: dir_path (target subdirectory) and pattern (required). Use correct pattern syntax and valid paths. Can be invoked multiple times for validation.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with parameters: source_path (full path of the file to move) and destination_path (full path and new name, if renaming). Ensure paths exist and are correct. Invoke multiple times for validation.
read_file:read_file: Read a file from disk. Parameters: 'file_path' (required) - must be an absolute path and include the file name and extension. Ensure the file exists on the filesystem. The tool can be invoked multiple times for validation. Example: {'file_path':'/absolute/path/to/file.txt'}.
write_file:write_file: Writes specified text to a file at a defined path. Parameters: file_path (required, existing file/folder path), text (required, content to write), append (optional, true to append). Validate file existence and write eligibility. Example: write_file(file_path='path/to/file.txt', text='Content', append=true). Multiple invocations allowed for validation checks.
list_directory:list_directory: Lists files and subdirectories in a valid directory path. Parameters: dir_path: Specify an existing folder path. Avoid filtering by file type or content in queries. Validate directory structure and invoke multiple times for accurate results. Examples: 'List all in ProjectA/Docs', 'Show contents of /Data/Input'.
