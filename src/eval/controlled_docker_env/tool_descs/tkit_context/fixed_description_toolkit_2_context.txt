copy_file:copy_file: Copies a single file to a specified location. Parameters: source_path (required, must be an existing file), destination_path (required, must be a valid save path with matching file extension). Directories are not allowed. Invoke multiple times for validations. Example: Copy 'source.txt' to 'backup/source.txt'.
file_delete:file_delete: Delete a file by specifying a valid, existing file path. Ensure paths are correctly formatted and validated. The tool can be used multiple times for filesystem state validation. Example: {'file_path':'valid/path/to/file.txt'}.
file_search:file_search: Recursively find files in a subdirectory using '*.<extension>' for patterns (e.g., '*.csv'). Specify accurate 'dir_path' without spaces or special characters. Validate inputs before search. Tool can be used multiple times to verify file system state. Examples: {'dir_path': 'ProjectA/data', 'pattern': '*.csv'}
move_file:move_file: Relocate or rename a file by specifying full paths. Use 'source_path' for the file to move and 'destination_path' for its new location or name. Verify paths for accuracy. Example: Move file.txt from /start/ to /end/file_new.txt. Invoke multiple times for validation.
read_file:read_file: Reads file content from disk. Parameters: file_path (required) - exact path of the file. Ensure paths are precise and operations are limited to reading. Use multiple invocations for comprehensive file system validation. Example: {'file_path': 'ProjectB/source/main.py'}.
write_file:write_file: Save text to a specified file path. Parameters: file_path (string, required, valid path with extension), text (string, required), append (boolean, optional, for text files only). Only valid text file types are supported. Validate paths and types before use. Invoke tool multiple times to ensure correct file state.
list_directory:list_directory: List files and directories in a specified folder. Use parameter 'dir_path' for the exact path. For filtering files, make separate queries. Validate paths before use. Examples: {'dir_path': '02_Research/01_Papers'}. Can be invoked multiple times for state validation.
