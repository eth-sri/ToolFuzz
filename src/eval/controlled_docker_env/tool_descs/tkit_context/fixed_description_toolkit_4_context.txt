copy_file:copy_file: Duplicate a file by specifying full paths, including filenames, for both source and destination. Only supports copy operations, not move or rename. Ensure destination path doesn't imply file modification. Invoke multiple times for filesystem state validation. E.g., copy_file(source_path='src/file.txt', destination_path='dst/file.txt').
file_delete:file_delete: Delete a file using the full file path. Ensure the 'file_path' argument is an existing, complete path. Validate paths prior to execution. Example: {'file_path': '01_Projects/01_ProjectA/01_Code/utils.py'}. Invoke multiple times for verifying file system state.
file_search:file_search: Search files in a subdirectory matching a Unix shell regex pattern. Use lowercase in 'dir_path' with no spaces. Apply patterns like '*.ext'. Example: {'dir_path':'project/docs','pattern':'*.md'}. Invoke multiple times for validation.
move_file:move_file: Move or rename a file with precise paths. Use 'source_path' and 'destination_path' parameters with valid, complete paths. Ensure paths exist before execution. Example: move_file(source_path='folder/file.txt', destination_path='new_folder/file.txt'). Invoke multiple times for validation.
read_file:read_file: Reads a file from disk using absolute paths with file extensions. Ensure paths are complete and match the file system. Avoid ambiguous terms; specify exact file names and directories. Validate paths before use. Invoke the tool multiple times to confirm file system state. Example: {'file_path':'/project/code/main.py'}.
write_file:write_file: Write text to a file with parameters: 'file_path' (required, file location), 'text' (required, content to write), 'append' (optional, default false, true to add content). Ensure parameters are distinct and correctly formatted. Invoke multiple times for validation. Example: {'file_path':'path/to/file.txt','text':'content','append':true}
list_directory:list_directory: Use to list files and directories in a specific folder. Only specify the directory path using 'dir_path'. Avoid searching for file types or contents. For example, use 'dir_path': 'example_folder' to list its contents. The tool can be invoked multiple times for validation.
