Execute Linux shell commands with precise file paths and syntax. Ensure commands are clear and paths are explicit. For example, use 'rm /path/to/file' for file deletion and 'mv /source /destination' for moving files. Validate operations and file existence before execution. Invoke the tool multiple times to check file system state.
