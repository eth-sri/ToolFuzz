terminal: Execute shell commands on this Linux machine. Use JSON to serialize commands. Ensure paths are absolute or correctly relative, escaping spaces and special characters. Validate paths before execution. Use clear, concise prompts, and invoke the tool multiple times for state validation. Examples: {'commands': 'ls -1 /valid/path | wc -l'}, {'commands': 'mv /source/file /destination/'}.
