copy_file: Duplicate a file from 'source_path' to 'destination_path'. Ensure both paths exist, are valid, and retain file extensions. Avoid overwriting unintended files. Validate paths pre and post-operation. Use distinct destination names. Invoke tool multiple times for validation.
file_delete: Deletes a file with absolute path. Ensure the file path is correct and exists. Use absolute paths only. Example: {'file_path':'/your/absolute/path/to/file.txt'}. The tool can be invoked multiple times to verify system state.
file_search: Recursively find files in a specified subdirectory matching a Unix shell regex pattern. Parameters: dir_path (relative path), pattern (Unix shell regex, * matches any characters). Use simple paths and validate regex patterns for consistency. Invoke the tool multiple times for thorough validation.
move_file: Move or rename a file using absolute paths. Parameters: source_path:required (existing file path), destination_path:required (new file path, same extension). Validate paths before execution. Invoke multiple times to check file system state. Example: move_file(source_path='/path/to/file.txt', destination_path='/new/path/to/file.txt').
read_file: Access a file using its full path and filename (including extension). Ensure path accuracy and match the exact file system entries. Validate paths before execution and consider multiple invocations for state checks. Example: {'file_path':'/path/to/file.txt'}
write_file: This tool writes text to a specified text file on disk. Parameters: file_path (required, valid path to a text file), text (required, content to write), append (optional, true to add, false to overwrite). Avoid non-text formats like PDFs/DOCX. Validate file existence and paths, and use the tool iteratively for dynamic file states.
list_directory: Lists files and directories in a specified folder. Use valid absolute or relative paths for 'dir_path' within the base context. Ensure paths exist and are correctly formatted. Invoke multiple times for comprehensive validation. Example: {'dir_path': '/base/folder/subfolder'}.
