copy_file: Duplicate a file to a specified location, ensuring file formats match. Provide explicit source and destination paths. Validate paths before use to avoid overwriting. Invoke multiple times for accurate file system state.
file_delete: Delete a file by providing a complete, absolute file path. Ensure the path is correctly formatted and includes the full directory and file name with extension, e.g., '/path/to/file.txt'. Only absolute paths are accepted. The tool can be invoked multiple times for better validation.
Search recursively in a subdirectory for files matching a Unix shell pattern. Parameters: 'dir_path' (relative path) and 'pattern' (e.g., '*.txt'). Use valid patterns and relative paths. Invoke the tool multiple times to validate the file system.
move_file: Moves or renames a file with absolute paths and matching file types. Parameters: source_path (absolute, required, with extension), destination_path (absolute, required, with extension). Ensure directories exist and file types match. Can be invoked multiple times to validate the file system state.
read_file: Reads a file from disk using a valid file path. Ensure the file exists, and the path is correct. Avoid directories and unsupported files. Use multiple invocations to validate the file system state. Supported formats: txt, pdf, docx. Examples: {'file_path': '/path/to/file.txt'}.
write_file: Save text to a file on disk with parameters: file_path (required, valid path), text (required), append (optional, default false). Supports text files; other formats may require conversion. Validate file paths and system state before use. Can be invoked multiple times for checks. Examples: 'write_file(file_path="/path/to/file.txt", text="Hello", append=true)' to add text, or 'write_file(file_path="/path/to/file.txt", text="Hello")' to overwrite.
list_directory: Lists all files and directories within a specified path. Parameters: dir_path (string) - a complete directory path. Ensure paths are correct and avoid querying for specific files or formats. Use the tool solely for listing purposes, invoking multiple times if needed for validation.
