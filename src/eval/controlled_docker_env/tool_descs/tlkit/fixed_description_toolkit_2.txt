copy_file: Duplicates a file to a specified location. Parameters: source_path (required): Full path of the file to copy. destination_path (required): Full path, including file name, to save the copy. Both paths must have the same file type. For validation, run the tool multiple times.
file_delete: Deletes a file using a full path (e.g., /root/folder/file.pdf). Ensure paths are accurate and validated. Avoid using aliases or incomplete paths. You can invoke this tool multiple times to ensure consistent file system state. Examples: {'file_path':'/home/user/docs/file.txt'}
file_search: Recursively find files in a specified subdirectory using a regex pattern. Parameters: dir_path (valid subdirectory name), pattern (regex, e.g., '.*\.pdf$' for PDFs). Avoid shell wildcards like '*'. Use multiple searches for comprehensive results.
move_file: Move or rename files with distinct source and destination paths, maintaining file types. Source_path and destination_path must be full paths. Verify paths to avoid errors. Invoke multiple times for validation. Examples: Rename file.txt to new_file.txt in the same folder or move file.txt from folder A to folder B.
read_file: Reads file content from disk. Parameters: file_path: required, full absolute path to the file, including the filename. Only retrieves file content, not metadata or summaries. Validate file existence and readability before use. Example: read_file('/path/to/file.txt'). Use multiple invocations for thorough filesystem checks.
write_file: Save text to a specified file with parameters: file_path (absolute path, required), text (required), append (true to add, false to overwrite). Validate file paths exist, are writable, and compatible file types are used (.txt, .docx). Invoke tool multiple times to confirm valid file system state.
list_directory: Lists files and directories in a specified folder. Use absolute paths only. Ensure the directory exists before listing. Invalid paths or shorthand references will result in errors. Can be invoked multiple times for comprehensive checks. Examples: {'dir_path': '/path/to/directory'}.
