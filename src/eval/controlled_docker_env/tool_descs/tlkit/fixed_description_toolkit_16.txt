copy_file: Duplicate a file from source_path to destination_path. Paths must be accessible and filenames should maintain the same extension. Avoid overwrites by ensuring unique destination filenames. Validate paths before operation. Tool can be invoked multiple times for validation.
file_delete: Delete a file using the 'file_path' parameter, which must be an absolute, valid path. Ensure the file exists before deletion. The tool can be invoked multiple times to verify file system state. Examples: {'file_path':'/path/to/file.txt'}.
file_search: Search subdirectories for files using simple keyword patterns. Use relative paths for dir_path and avoid explicit file formats in patterns. Patterns should be keyword-based, avoiding special characters. Invoke the tool multiple times for validation. Examples: {'dir_path':'thesis','pattern':'draft*'} or {'dir_path':'Movies','pattern':'*comedy*'}.
move_file: Move or rename a file with valid paths. Parameters: source_path (required, existing file path) and destination_path (required, new file path). Paths must be valid, and overwriting files should be intentional. Multiple invocations can help validate paths.
read_file: Reads a file from disk. Parameters: file_path (required) - a precise, absolute path to a supported file format (e.g., .txt, .pdf). Ensure the file exists and is readable. Focus only on reading content. The tool can be invoked multiple times for system state verification. Example: {'file_path': '/path/to/file.txt'}
write_file: Write text to disk. Parameters: file_path (required, must be a valid text file path), text (required, content to write), append (optional, true to append). Supports only text-based files like .txt. Validate file paths and formats. Invoke multiple times to ensure correct operations.
list_directory: Lists files and directories in a specified folder. Parameters: dir_path (absolute directory path). Ensure paths are valid and exist. Use absolute paths for accuracy. Invoke multiple times to verify file system state. Example: {'dir_path': '/valid/absolute/path'}.
