copy_file: Duplicates a file using full paths, ensuring consistent names and formats. Parameters: source_path (required) - original file path, destination_path (required) - target copy path. Avoid overwriting and format changes. Validate paths to ensure file system integrity. Invoke tool multiple times if necessary.
file_delete: Deletes a file using these parameters: file_path:required: Provide a full, absolute path of the file to delete. Ensure the file exists before deletion. Use direct commands; avoid questions or descriptions. The tool supports multiple invocations to verify file system state. E.g., file_delete('/path/to/file.txt').
file_search: Recursively search for files using Unix shell wildcards (* matches any string) in a specified subdirectory. Parameters: dir_path (relative subdirectory path), pattern (wildcard pattern, requires file extensions). Validate paths and patterns separately before running. Use iteratively for dynamic checks.
move_file: Move or rename a file using valid absolute paths. Parameters: source_path (required): Existing file path. destination_path (required): New valid file path. Ensure paths and names are correct and unique. Avoid overwriting. Invoke multiple times for validation.
read_file: This tool reads files from disk using a specified absolute file path. Ensure paths are correctly formatted, point to existing files, and are readable. The tool supports standard text and document formats. Validate file paths and existence before use. The tool can be invoked multiple times to check file system state.
write_file: Writes text to a specified .txt file on disk. Parameters: file_path (required, must be a .txt file), text (required), append (optional, defaults to false). Only text files are supported. Validate file existence before appending. Invoke tool multiple times for accurate file state validation.
list_directory: Lists all files and directories in the specified absolute directory path. Use 'dir_path' to provide a valid, absolute path. Avoid specifying file types or content filters. Tool can be invoked multiple times for comprehensive directory evaluation. Example: {'dir_path': '/absolute/path/to/directory'}
