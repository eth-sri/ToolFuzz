copy_file: Duplicate a file to a specified location. Parameters: source_path (required): Valid file path to copy. destination_path (required): Valid path to save the copy. Ensure paths exist and formats match. Avoid overwrites unless desired. Validate paths and names.
file_delete: Deletes a file. Usage: Provide a full, absolute file path as 'file_path'. Ensure the path is correct, exists, and is not a directory or symlink. Example: '/path/to/file.txt'. You can invoke the tool multiple times for validation.
file_search: Recursively search for files in a subdirectory using the specified regex pattern. Parameters: dir_path (subdirectory to search in, full or relative) and pattern (required, Unix shell-style regex, e.g., '*file*.txt'). Validate paths and patterns for accuracy. Invoke tool multiple times for comprehensive file system validation.
move_file: Use to move or rename a file. Ensure source_path and destination_path are valid, full paths with consistent file types. The destination must not overwrite an existing file unless intended. Invoke the tool multiple times to verify the file system state.
read_file: Access file content from disk using a valid file path (absolute path required). Only reading is supported; other operations are not. Validate file existence and format compatibility. For better accuracy, invoke multiple times to ensure file system state.
Use write_file to handle text-based (.txt) files only. Provide complete file paths. Set 'append' to true for adding or false for overwriting. Verify file existence before appending. Execute tool multiple times for file system validation. Non-text files like PDFs are not supported.
list_directory: Lists all files and directories within an absolute directory path. Use absolute paths only; do not search for specific files. Invoke multiple times for consistent directory state verification.
