copy_file: Duplicate a file to a specified location with parameters: source_path: Path of the file to copy, must include file name and extension. destination_path: Full path with desired file name and extension. Paths must be valid and file types compatible. Invoke multiple times for file system validation.
file_delete: Delete a file by providing an absolute file path in quotes. Ensure the file exists and the path is correct. Use multiple invocations to validate file system state. Avoid partial paths or non-existent files. Example: {'file_path': '/path/to/file.txt'}.
file_search: Recursively search files in a directory matching a regex pattern. Use standard regex syntax. Parameters: dir_path (required): Directory path. pattern (required): Regex pattern (e.g., '^file.*\.docx$'). Validate patterns and invoke multiple times if needed.
Move or rename a file with: source_path (existing file path), destination_path (new file path, same extension). Ensure paths are valid and extensions match. Invoke multiple times for validation. E.g., move_file('old/path/file.txt', 'new/path/file.txt'). Avoid overwriting folders.
read_file: Reads a file from disk. Parameters: file_path (required) - Full absolute path of the file. Ensure the file exists and paths are correctly specified. This tool only reads files, not analyses or summaries. It can be invoked multiple times for validation.
write_file: Write text to a plain text file (.txt) on disk. Parameters: file_path (required) - specify the full path; text (required) - content to write; append (optional) - true to add content, false to overwrite. Ensure the file format is supported and validate the path. Use the tool iteratively for accurate file system updates. Examples: 1) {'file_path': 'notes.txt', 'text': 'Lecture summary', 'append': true}. 2) {'file_path': 'report.txt', 'text': 'New report', 'append': false}.
list_directory: List files and directories in a specified folder. Use an absolute path for 'dir_path' starting from the root, ensuring the path exists. Validate paths for correctness. The tool can be invoked multiple times for better validation. Example: list_directory('/absolute/path/to/directory').
