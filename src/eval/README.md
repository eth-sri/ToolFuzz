In this package all of our evaluation scripts are present. Each evaluation category has its own README at the respective root directory.

1. `baseline` - these are White box ToolFuzz and Gray Box Toolfuzz scritps
2. `controlled_docker_env` - scripts for the File Management Agent benchmark
3. `controlled_git` - scripts for the GitHub Agent benchmark
4. `cross_tool_calling` - script for testing cross tool calls.
5. `wikidata_test` - benchmark not present in the paper/thesis, which evaluates the `wikidata` and `wikipedia` tools against WikiQA which we have extended with questions from late 2024.
